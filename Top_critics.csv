the_dark_knight,"This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie",13-Dec-17,Glenn Kenny,MUBI
the_dark_knight,"Too much psychology and not enough pop. It's possible to be too serious, you know.",2-Jun-17,Ryan Gilbey,New Statesman
the_dark_knight,You will feel utterly numb after the screening of The Dark Knight. The film is bleak and brilliant.,31-May-17,James Christopher,Times (UK)

soul_2020,"The beauty of ""Soul"" is that, just as animation is finding more being demanded of it, Pixar is answering that demand.",22-Dec-20,Mick LaSalle,San Francisco Chronicle
soul_2020,"There's a definite satisfaction to how expectation-defying the film is, with its hairpin twists and turns, though some of the surprises stem from the way that Soul can't entirely figure out how its two worlds mesh together thematically.",21-Dec-20,Alison Willmore,New York Magazine/Vulture
soul_2020,"Far from teaching children to follow their dreams, the movie... advocates leaving the dreaming to the pros.",21-Dec-20,Richard Brody,New Yorker
soul_2020,"Like the best Pixar films, ""Soul"" isn't just for kids. There are lessons here for all ages, some surprisingly complex.",20-Dec-20,Bill Goodykoontz,Arizona Republic
