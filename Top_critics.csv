the_dark_knight,0,"This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie","December 13, 2017 ",Glenn Kenny,MUBI
the_dark_knight,1,"Too much psychology and not enough pop. It's possible to be too serious, you know.","June 2, 2017 ",Ryan Gilbey,New Statesman

the_dark_knight,3,"This is an impressive film in many ways, and Nolan directs with real confidence, yet the overall result feels cumbersome.","August 20, 2014 ",Jonathan Romney,Independent on Sunday
the_dark_knight,4,Among the great strengths of The Dark Knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts and setpieces you expect in summer blockbusters.,"August 20, 2014 ",Geoffrey Macnab,Independent (UK)
the_dark_knight,5,"To talk of Heath Ledger's performance is difficult, merely because, as gigantic as it is, it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas.","August 20, 2014 ",Tiru Thiruvilangam,Little White Lies
soul_2020,0,"The sharpest Pixar screenplay in years, with a screwball vibe and consistently witty use of cutaway gags. So much of it works at such a high level. What keeps it from achieving greatness?","December 22, 2020 ",Steven D. Greydanus,National Catholic Register

soul_2020,2,"The beauty of ""Soul"" is that, just as animation is finding more being demanded of it, Pixar is answering that demand.","December 22, 2020 ",Mick LaSalle,San Francisco Chronicle
soul_2020,3,"There's a definite satisfaction to how expectation-defying the film is, with its hairpin twists and turns, though some of the surprises stem from the way that Soul can't entirely figure out how its two worlds mesh together thematically.","December 21, 2020 ",Alison Willmore,New York Magazine/Vulture
soul_2020,4,"Far from teaching children to follow their dreams, the movie... advocates leaving the dreaming to the pros.","December 21, 2020 ",Richard Brody,New Yorker
soul_2020,5,"Like the best Pixar films, ""Soul"" isn't just for kids. There are lessons here for all ages, some surprisingly complex.","December 20, 2020 ",Bill Goodykoontz,Arizona Republic
